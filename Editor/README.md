"At 0300 hours on 24 December Kampfgruppe Peiper, now reduced to approximately 800 men led by Peiper himself, had surreptitiously slipped away from La Gleize under cover of darkness. Major McCowan (commander of a battalion in the 119th Infantry, captured on 21 December while assaulting Stoumont) was the only one of the 171 American prisoners in La Gleize to go with the column. The rest were simply left there in the basement beneath the former Town Hall. At the commencement of his great drive to the Meuse River, Kampfgruppe Peiper consisted of 5,800 men that were later augmented by an additional battalion from the SS-Panzer-Grenadier Regiment 2. Now, there were only 800 left to sneak back through the woods to their own lines. As he moved back east he was forced to abandon 80 wounded in the Château de Froid-Cour and just over 300 in La Gleize.

"The tally in abandoned and destroyed German armor totaled around 87 tanks; 70 half-tracks; at least 14 flak wagons; 25 75mm assault guns and 105mm and 150mm self-propelled howitzers; plus trucks and smaller vehicles."
